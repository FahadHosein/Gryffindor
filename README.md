10/19/2021- "Ok so now the website has basic navigation functionality and the feel that you are actually logged in . Rn if you create your account it prompts you to log into the account that you just created , this is kinda bad but its not necessary that it be fixed. There is still no  real book appointment option , and the view results doesnt really work weeither , its just a for loop showing the first and last name 
of all appointments made . Dev plan as of right now is to get the appointment system working , then the view result system working , then maybe a staff page(not admin page)" - Jared
