10/19/2021- "Ok so now the website has basic navigation functionality and the feel that you are actually logged in . Rn if you create your account it prompts you to log into the account that you just created , this is kinda bad but its not necessary that it be fixed. There is still no  real book appointment option , and the view results doesnt really work weeither , its just a for loop showing the first and last name 
of all appointments made . Dev plan as of right now is to get the appointment system working , then the view result system working , then maybe a staff page(not admin page)" - Jared


10/28/2021 - The book appointment page now has an appointment form that can be filled out and submitted. The viewresults page allows you to see the booked appointment and the date+time as well as all the other information that you submitted in the form. It does not allow you to delete or update/change the appointment in any way . The date+time selector is very difficult to use on the bookappointment page . It definitely needs a better entry method . The phone number entry fields could use some checcks as well. There is still no staff page and the admin page still has the word django on it .
