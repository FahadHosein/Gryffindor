    <p>Welcome to the PCR(Polymerase Chain Reaction) Test Appointment System. As quarantine protocols such as travel and business restictions are being lifted, a test is required to engage in these activities. This website implements fast and simple scheduling of PCR appointments based on your purpose for obtaining a test. This implementation also limits the number of persons entering the facility which helps with adherence to National health regulations and protocols. Create an account and schedule an appointment below. If you already have an account, login to schedule or view an appointment.</p>
